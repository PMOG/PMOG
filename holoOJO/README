holoOJO

A GUI for hologram manipulation with Matlab.

To run the GUI execute hojoOJO.m.

The routine supports phase and complex modulation using a blazed grating.  The user can choose the following types of beams:
- LAGUERRE-GAUSSIAN
- BESSEL BEAMS
- FLAT-TOP
- USER DEFINED

Once the type of desired beam is selected, modify the parameters to suit your needs.  The "user defined" option accepts any matlab function (in the path) with the coordinates X,Y,THETA or RHO.
